## Making sharing and streaming as easy as taking a picture

### Broadcast Reliably

Whether you're streaming a birthday or celebration from your phone, hosting the Olympics, or running a pay-per-view event, swirl has you covered. Its new, non-proprietary live streaming server & clients provide world-class reliability, using the legendary availability and low latency performance built into the Erlang/OTP platform.

### Start streaming now — or later

Be first with the news. No need to wait for a broadcast or event to end, swirl lets you stream the moment you have the first frames on camera. But if you're late to the party, don't worry, you won't have missed a thing. Swirl is ready to kick off when you are — just pick up where you left off, on any device.

### Open & standard

Unlike all those other tools, Swirl is both open source and open development, built on an open standard, with peer-to-peer scalability and fault-tolerance baked in from the beginning.

The application is based on the IETF draft Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol, known as PPSP normally. The protocol includes innovative features for fast streaming, security and performance, and is compatible with current network infrastructure without rearchitecting or forklift upgrades.
